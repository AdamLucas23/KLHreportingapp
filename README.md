## Getting Started

### **1. Prerequisites**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- Git
- AWS account (for Secrets Manager integration)

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

---

### **3. Run in Development**
To run the project locally with a **local credentials file**:
```bash
VITE_USE_LOCAL_CREDS=true npm run dev
```

Open your browser to:  
```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### **4. AWS Secrets Manager Setup**
Each company should have a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager in this format:

```json
{
  "m365": {
    "tenant_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "client_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "client_secret": "REPLACE_WITH_SECRET"
  },
  "proofpoint": {
    "username": "api-user@example.com",
    "password": "REPLACE",
    "primary_domain": "example.com"
  },
  "duo": {
    "ikey": "DIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "skey": "REPLACE",
    "host": "api-XXXX.duosecurity.com"
  },
  "s1": {
    "api_host": "usea1-cw02.sentinelone.net",
    "api_token": "REPLACE",
    "site_id": "123456789012345678"
  }
}
```

The app will automatically load companies by reading all secrets with the prefix:
```
prod/client-reporting/
```

---

### **5. Build for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` folder.

---

## Security Notes
- **Never commit real credentials** â€” keep sensitive files in the `config/` folder and use `.gitignore` to prevent uploading.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for all production secrets.
